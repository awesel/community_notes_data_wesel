1789,タイヤのトレッド面に刺さっている釘が原因でパンクした場合、「ほとんどが人為的である」とのことですが、さすがに言いすぎだと思います。例えば私は100%シャッター付きの車庫に入庫していますが、それでも釘が刺さることは、短期間ではありませんが、複数回ありました。  写真のようなワイドトレッドの車両の場合、刺さる確率はどうしても高くなります。工事現場の周囲には釘が落ちていることが多く、そういう場所を多く通行する車は、釘によるパンクが起こりやすいです。またワイドトレッドの車両で、不必要に路側に寄って走行・路上駐車の多い車も、パンクしやすい傾向があります。  参考  https://jaf.or.jp/common/news/2022/20220915-001,False,,1652422507453108224,MISINFORMED_OR_POTENTIALLY_MISLEADING,True,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
