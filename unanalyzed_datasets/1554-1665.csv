While that number is factually correct, it’s lacking some context.  Most of the drop is because of the recovery from COVID, and the government spending during that time coming to an end.  There’s no indication that any policies have specifically targeted the deficit.

States with the strongest gun laws have the lowest gun death rates, and vice versa. While gun extremist politicians claim to be tough on crime, they work to make it easier for anyone to get a gun and carry it in public—no questions asked.

Earlier this year I attended a social security hearing. It was chilling. I watched first hand how Rick Scott, Mitt Romney, and Lindsey Graham talked so casually about stripping away peoples means of living. We must ensure they don’t have the chance. #ProtectOurSocialSecurity

Here are the facts: Crude oil prices are DOWN. And yet…gas prices are up. That’s because greedy oil companies are ripping you off.

They are raking in record profits at your expense.

I’m calling for a new tax on these corrupt oil companies to put money back in your pocket.

On Friday, we asked oil companies: as crude oil is down, why are their profits up, & why does CA have skyrocketing gas prices? It doesn’t add up.

Some were evasive, most didn’t respond at all.

Oil refinery costs & profits rose 240% from August to September, costing you more.

This is what people said the ""way out"" of World War II was -- total, unqualified defeat inflicted on Japan and Germany, with no settlement possible. Hence the decision to inflict total destruction on Germany and Japan, and cap off the strategy by dropping two nuclear bombs

The fourth amendment protects citizens' privacy from government overreach by requiring authorities to get a warrant to search private homes and businesses. It does apply to private companies. Social media sites do not need a warrant to gather data as you use their platforms.
