Birdwatch notes are routinely applied to tweets from Congressional members of both parties.

An example of a Republican Senator having a Birdwatch note applied is this tweet by John Kennedy posted earlier this week: twitter.com/SenJohnKennedy‚Ä¶

This story is stunning.

In short: Alito himself leaked the Dobbs decision, and not only that, he's leaked his own opinions before, to right-wing litigants, so they could wine and dine other justices, and donate to their causes, to secure their vote.

Former Anti-Abortion Leader Alleges Another Supreme Court Breach
Years before the leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, a landmark contraception ruling was disclosed, according to a minister who led a secretive effort to influence justices.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The article, taken at its face value, neither states Alito leaked the Dobbs decision, nor that there was a quid pro quo involving ""securing their votes"".

The Biden-Harris Administration lowered the deficit with the single largest one-year reduction in American history.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
COVID-driven deficits in both FY20 & 21 were roughly double the previous record (09), making the drop to FY22 sizeable.

But the FY22 deficit is still the 4th largest in history and is 41% larger than FY19.
