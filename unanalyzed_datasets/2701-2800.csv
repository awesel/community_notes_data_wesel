The Fed just announced it will introduce its “FedNow” Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in July. CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny.

While cash transactions are anonymous, a #CBDC will allow the government to surveil all our private financial affairs. The central bank will have the power to enforce dollar limits on our transactions restricting where you can send money, where you can spend it, and when money expires.

A CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.

The Fed will initially limit its CBDC to interbank transactions but we should not be blind to the obvious danger that this is the first step in banning and seizing bitcoin as the Treasury did with gold 90 years ago today in 1933.

Watch as governments, which never let a good crisis go to waste, use Covid-19 and the banking crisis to usher in a new wave of CBDCs as a safe haven from germ-laden paper currencies or as protection against bank runs.

NEW | It’s official. LTNs work.

We just published the biggest ever study on low traffic neighbourhoods and the results are clear.

LTNs significantly reduce traffic. It’s that simple.

The Low Traffic Neighbourhoods I delivered in Hackney actually improved ambulance attendance times by clearing away the rat-runners.

The 'antisemitism crisis' scam has always been Starmer's sole claim to a political identity, and I'm going to do everything in my power to take it away from him.
He does not, and will not ever, get away with it on here.

If the protestors used the mode of transport they want to see more of, we’d see a lot less of them. If they were in cars, probably only ten of them would be visible. And — as if this needs saying, but it clearly does — they would be stuck going nowhere for hours.

16/ So that's why the DfT's minor revisions to the miles driven on our roads make no difference to the need for Low Traffic Neighbourhoods. 

LTNs, CPZs, & Roads Pricing are the top three methods for reducing cars in cities: https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213624X22000281…

Everything else is hot air.

I’ve never owned a car and neither has my wife.

It’s easy to to travel via public transport with kids. We’ve done it for 10 years.

LTNs are proven to reduce the violent and sexual crime on-street that disproportionately affects women.

You don’t speak for me or other parents.

It’s no coincidence that young men are some of the biggest advocates of killing off the car industry. They’re mostly fit and healthy; they can’t envisage otherwise. They can’t imagine being a mum carting around children nor the woman trying to get home without a taxi at night.
