Good lord, we have Vega v. Tekoh. The Supreme Court just gutted Miranda, ruling that a person who did NOT receive the warning has NO RIGHT to sue the government for the constitutional violation. 

6-3. By the people you'd expect. Jesus Christ.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The ruling did not eliminate the rights established in Miranda v. Arizona. The ruling states that you cannot sue for monetary compensation if your Miranda rights are violated. Your conviction can still be voided if your Miranda rights were violated. supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf…

You had an abortion. It's perfectly fine, btw, that you had an abortion but painting as anything other than an abortion is unbelievably delusional and dangerous too. You had an abortion on your own terms, which is great. But you're still advocating to ban that access for others.

Miraculous:  Prince Harry calls out Joe Biden’s ""rolling back of Constitutional rights in the United States"" as ""a global assault on democracy & freedom.""

Who would have thought the prince would speak out in support of free speech, religious liberty & the Second Amendment?

The armed bystander, who shot and killed the Greenwood Park Mall mass shooter, was identified as Elisjsha Dicken. He did not have a permit for the gun, but was carrying legally under Indiana's new ""Constitutional Carry"" law.
wthr.com
Police: Armed bystander shot and killed Greenwood Park Mall shooter in just 15 seconds
Those killed are 56-year-old Pedro Pineda, his wife 37-year-old Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda and 30-year-old Victor Gomez.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The law, commonly referred to as ""Constitutional Carry"", renders the entire concept of a permit moot. That's the entire point.

The second sentence of the law's digest: ""Repeals the law that requires a person to obtain a license to carry a handgun in Indiana.""

When climate change deniers say we had a heatwave like this in 1976 show them this.

We shouldn't have political leaders debating whether to abandon Net Zero 2050 commitments.

In fact we need to get there much much faster.

We need to treat climate change as the emergency it is.

What happened is scientists discovered chlorofluorocarbons were bad for the ozone, countries believed them, the Montreal Protocol was signed, and CFC use fell by 99.7%, leading to the stabilization of the ozone layer, perhaps the greatest example of global cooperation in history.

Remember when they spent years telling us to panic over the hole in the ozone layer and then suddenly just stopped talking about it and nobody ever mentioned the ozone layer again?
Readers added context
24 nations signed the Montreal Protocol limiting the use of CFCs in 1987. Scientists estimate that if the Montreal Protocol had never been implemented, the hole would have grown by 40 percent by 2013. Instead, the hole is expected to completely heal by 2050.

With assault rifles, exit wounds can be a foot wide. The victim’s skull explodes on impact. Organs rupture, bones shatter, the shards serve as shrapnel and tear tissue to pieces.

There is a reason we never see the images after a mass murder—many of the bodies no longer exist.

Trump got his passports seized by the FBI. This means Trump can no longer flee to Saudi Arabia. He can no longer seek asylum in Russia. Trump can’t run away from this. He has to stay in the US — the country he betrayed — until he is indicted for one of his many federal crimes.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
It appears the passports were not 'seized;' they were with items siezed by the FBI but were found by a team that checks for privleged information or other items that should be returned and set aside to be released back to Trump.  mobile.twitter.com/kyledcheney/st…

No running water in Jackson. The heat index is 102 degrees. Schools and universities are closed. No way to cook, clean, bathe. This is capital city, and the biggest city in Mississippi. #jxnwatercrisis

Here's liberal bias for you: This tweet is focusing on Texas, the comments are blaming red state rubes...but the state w the biggest Covid decline in life is NEW YORK, with a life expectancy decline of THREE FUCKING YRS! Dem gov, legislature, mayors, federal reps! UNACCEPTABLE!!!

Garland sends memo warning DOJ against talking to Congress | Just The News https://trib.al/wnDExVn
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The memo just reminded employees about a rule that was last updated in 2019, stemming from a 1939 law. Read the rule here:

justice.gov/jm/jm-1-8000-c…

In a separate memo, AG Garland banned political appointees from attending partisan campaign events, since the DOJ is supposed to be non-political.

By the time everything is unraveled for the country to see, Trump’s entire “Presidency” will be annulled. His Supreme Court appointments will be rescinded (and their rulings invalidated). His appointments expunged. His executive orders, tax cuts, and legislative actions reversed.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
There is no constitutional mechanism to “annul” Supreme Court Justices once they have been confirmed. The constitutional remedy is impeachment by congress, which does not invalidate their rulings. Furthermore, justices are only nominated by the POTUS, not appointed by him.

This seems to be a misunderstanding of annual punishing statistics which show sales of all books regardless of year of publication. It's definitely not true that most newly published books manage less than a dozen sales.
