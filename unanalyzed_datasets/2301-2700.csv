The FDA has now endorsed treating COVID with Ivermectin! The FDA has blood on its hands. How many Americans senselessly died because Big Medicine called this cheap, readily available Nobel Prize winning medicine horse paste?

Thank you Ron Johnson your leadership and bravery.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
The FDA has not endorsed or authorized ivermectin for use as a treatment for COVID-19

fda.gov/consumers/cons…

The FDA has simply given the recommendation that ivermectin not be used. This does not forbid or recommend doctors take any action in prescribing the medication. "

第49回衆議院選挙時の有権者数は

棄権者総数約4640万名、4800万は無効票約140万を誤算入している可能性があります。

棄権者がもし投票したとしたと仮定した場合の投票先は不明ですが、実際の投票先の比率と乖離が大きいことはありうるとしても、全数れいわということはほぼあり得ません。
れいわ新撰組当時の世論調査政党支持率0.5-2%程度で比例得票約3.86%でしたから、棄権層が投票したと推定するにしても棄権者のうち10%とかであればまだしも、80%とか100%というのは非現実的です。

原発処理水の放出にお墨付き…IAEAは本当に「中立」か 日本は巨額の分担金、電力業界も人員派遣

IAEAはどこまで信を置けるのか。かねて日本政府は、IAEAに巨額の分担金や拠出金を支出してきた。IAEAのお墨付きは、中立的な立場から出たと受け止めるべきか？

中立性に疑義を挟むのであれば、今年のIAEAの通常予算の分担率は日本に抗議した中国が14.7%、日本7.7%という前提を抑えて下さい。
また福島第一原発が２２兆ベクレル未満を予定しているのに対し、中国の秦山第３原発だけで約１４３兆ベクレル、他にも福島の数倍も排出している原発が林立しています。

元より2022年の非公式基本合意の際にただし書きとして2026年にe-Fuel(非化石燃料由来の電気と二酸化炭素を科学反応で合成した燃料)を含む代替燃料の技術進捗を評価する文言があり、それが2023年に前倒しになったという経緯であり撤回という表現は不適切です。
また、この決定で容認されたエンジン車はe-Fuel専焼に限定されており通常のガソリンやディーゼルエンジン車の存続を容認したものではありません。

より 

We live in a world where the illegality of war has progressed. Even amidst these illegal wars, humanity has attempted to establish rules. Having experienced the catastrophic war known as World War I, mankind prohibited the killing and injuring of non-combatants in warfare. Cluster bombs greatly violate this rule as they result in the killing of innocent civilians unrelated to combat. A weapon that can never be used when considering ourselves as fellow human beings. This is what cluster bombs are.  　私達は、戦争の違法化が進んだ世界に生きている。その違法な戦争の中でも人類は、ルール化を試みてきた。第一次世界大戦という悲惨な戦争を経験した人類は、戦争において非戦闘員を殺傷する事を禁じた。 　クラスター爆弾は、このルールにも大きく違反する。戦闘とは関係のない無辜の市民を殺害する結果となるからだ。 同じ人間だと思っていたら決して使えない兵器。これがクラスター爆弾だ。

製造に関して原材料にかかるサプライチェーンに海外依存性があるのはEVに限らず既存のHV含めICE(エンジン車)も同様です。

運用面ではICEが輸入した化石燃料に常時依存するのに対し、BEVに必要な電気は日本政府が目標とする脱炭素化された電源構成、原子力発電(ウランは要輸入だが比率的に微小かつ数年単位の調達余裕がある)、再エネは設備の原材料の大半は輸入であるが原料リサイクルにより間接的に輸入依存度を低減可能な性質があります。

NEW ARTICLE: Families that inject mRNA together, develop Turbo Cancer together?

12 unbelievable stories of two or three COVID-19 vaccinated family members developing aggressive turbo cancer at the same time!

It's happening. Turbo cancers are skyrocketing and some families will have two, even three members develop aggressive turbo cancer at Stage 4!

When multiple family members come down with cancer and a COVID-19 vaccine induced turbo cancer is suspected, always look for the presence of at least one of these: leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, breast cancer.

Presumably, if multiple family members went to get their COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, they may have received a “bad batch” or “hot lot”, a toxic pharmaceutical product with poor quality control that may have had too much mRNA or may have been contaminated with DNA plasmids containing the carcinogenic SV40 promoter!

The immune system damage and organ damage that those family members might then experience from a “bad vaccine batch” or a “hot lot”, may be similar and may give rise to turbo cancers in multiple family members.

マイナンバーカードを保有するのも返納するのも、最初から持たないのも個人の自由です。
ただ、カードがない場合、住民票・印鑑証明のコンビニでの取得や保険証としての利用などができなくなるだけで、マイナンバーがなくなったり、銀行口座などが串刺しできなくなるわけではないのでご注意ください。あくまで影響は、本人が不便になるだけです。
マイナンバーは国民全員に発行済であり、赤ちゃんが生まれると自動で割り当てられ、住民票にも記録され、消えることはありません。

割合表記では「母数が何か」が重要とされています。
toyokeizai.net/articles/-/833…

本ツイートに含まれる記事のタイトルの「4割」の母数は「総返納件数（247件）」ですが、明記されておらず「総発行件数」と誤認する恐れがあるので注意が必要です。

また、その他の返納は再発行や外国人の在留期間短縮にともなう返納であり、「本人希望（など）」という表現も誤認を生む恐れがあるので、こちらも注意が必要です。

コミュニティノートは公開時に、公開日時の脇の丸囲いのｉマークをタップすることで作成者IDが確認できます
このIDはWikipediaと同じく匿名であり「公平性を担保」に関してはWikipediaとの差異は無いと言えます

また、コミュニティノートは参加者の評価（多数決では無い）によって結果が決まること、編集が不可の仕様であり修正時はノートを削除してゼロから作成し直す必要があること（評価もリセットされる）、運営側が政治性での参加条件の制約を設けていないことを踏まえると、ツイートで言われている政治工作に関しては事実上不可能と考えるのが妥当と言えます

Fascinerande tonläge ändå. Hur många av Sveriges kommuner har en egen symfoniorkester som till ca 90% finansieras av skattemedel? Är de som saknar en sådan barbariska? Självklart är kultur bra för ett samhälle men att prioritera att lägga så mycket på ett smalt prestigeprojekt… https://twitter.com/mymlan/status/1694436398508527753…

The Pentagon just successfully carried out a precision drone strike against ISIS-K, the group responsible for the airport bombing, killing their target. President Biden said yesterday, “We will hunt you down and make you pay."" He just delivered on that promise.

The existence, rights and dignity of trans people is not a debate. 

Feminism is about challenging gendered oppression. It should advocate for transwomen and people of marginalised genders - who are often at the sharpest end.

The notion that a human being can be neither male nor female based on their own ineffable internal sense of neitherness is an tenet of gender ideology.

It's not something a passport - a record of actual facts - needs to declare.
