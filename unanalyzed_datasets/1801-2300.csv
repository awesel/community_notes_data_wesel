The word ""grooming"" does not mean simply preparing a child for sexual predation by an adult. It can also mean an attempt to indoctrinate children into a perverse worldview. An enormous number schools, both public and private, are interested in precisely that sort of grooming.

Benedict helped to cover up endemic sexual abuse and then blamed it on secularization and the sexual revolution. He called Islam ""evil and inhuman."" He traveled to Africa and told people that condoms would make the AIDS crisis worse.
nytimes.com
Benedict was criticized for his handling of the church’s sex abuse scandal.
His efforts to rid the church of what he called “filth” went further than those of John Paul II, but he was reluctant to hold bishops accountable.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
In 2006, during a lecture on religious tolerance, Benedict quoted a 1391 writing by Manuel II, in which Manuel referred to Islam as ""evil."" Benedict did not coin the phrase,clarified it did not represent his belief, and later expressed ""deep regrets"" it was misinterpreted.

A Hunter College adjunct was fired after confronting a conservative anti-abortion group. She has since faced prolific harassment & death threats & fear for her life.

NYPD arrested HER on harassment & menacing charges after a NYPost reporter stalked her. https://hyperallergic.com/824363/artist-shellyne-rodriguez-arrested-in-the-bronx/…
Readers added context
The former Hunter College professor was arrested for holding a machete to the neck of a NYPost reporter and threatening to kill him.

“Hunter College strongly condemns the unacceptable actions of Shellyne Rodriguez”

Gender theory ideologues credentialed to perform surgeries is a horror plot. Oregon’s governor is likely to sign into law a bill that allows for minors as young as 15 to get sterilizing procedures (“bottom surgery”) without parental knowledge.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐞: “Amber lied about being sexually assaulted with a broken bottle / didn’t seek medical attention”

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡: Amber never claimed she was penetrated with a broken bottle. Both in reports to medical professionals and in her testimony, she recalls disassociating during the assault and HOPING the bottle wasn’t broken as there was so much glass and broken bottles around them. The assertion she’s lying because she didn’t seek medical attention after the assault is a heinous victim blaming tactic that ignores the fact most women don’t seek medical attention after being raped. It’s also worth noting Depp kept a team of in-house nurses and doctors on-call that could privately treat him and his wife. This testimony of SA was previously sealed in the UK, yet Amber was forced to recall it on live television - in front of strangers and the world - in an attempt to discredit and humiliate her. I hate even having to address this incident because it’s so sensitive and private, but in the interest of providing factual information to dispel lies it felt necessary to include.

BOOM: President Biden took the gloves off against a Trump supporter, referring to him as ""sleepy Joe"" and accusing him of corruption. 

It is worth noting that it is quite amusing to witness a Trump supporter criticizing someone else's integrity. 

However, Dark Brandon eloquently countered these remarks and stood his ground, challenging the guy to push-ups. The Trump supporter expressed his intention not to vote for Biden, to which Biden astutely replied, I know you won't my friend you are too old. #DemVoice1 #wtpBLUE

Tucker Carlson is feared because he doesn’t fear them. The days of killing truth/silencing journos w a hit piece are over. These tactics no longer work because millions want the truth - on both sides. Plethora of evidence that Jan 6 was an op - needs to be exposed/discussed.

Everything we said about Covid and its vaccination program turned out to be true:

You couldn't stop infection.
You couldn't stop transmission.
You couldn't prevent death.
You couldn't quarantine the virus.
You couldn't make places 'safe' with vaccine passports.
You couldn't stalk the virus with an app.
There were severe and unexpected reactions to the vaccine.
Curfews don't work on viruses.
Masks do more harm than good.
Too much hand sanitizer is bad for the skin.
Bottle shops are not safer than retail shops.
Lockdowns were destructive leading to economic and physical harm.
Almost all Covid rules were entirely pointless.
The government fines were illegal and are now being refunded.
Quarantine centres were a waste of money.
Our health experts acted like idiots.

Hospitals that are filling up with the largest ever (since the second world war) increase in heart attacks, strokes, and related conditions which are heavily suspected to be the result of Covid vaccines.

When you take into account a policy measure, you have to keep counting the deaths and injuries from the whole thing.

I’ve said this so many times. If the news stations have to work this hard to convince you that there is a pandemic and you need to be terrified—there likely isn’t one and you shouldn’t be. 

Common sense has overridden fear so they are now using overt threats and coercion.

In a major pandemic you don’t need to follow the news to see who is dying. It would be happening to family, friends, everyone would have a story. Instead we get scary anecdotes that when you look behind story, you see a moron idly obese “otherwise healthy” person.

Se ha consumado lo que temíamos: el PSOE, sin asumir su derrota, ha hecho determinante al independentismo.

¿Va a haber amnistía, referéndum y autodeterminación? ¿Hasta dónde llegan las cesiones de Pedro Sánchez?

Exigimos luz y taquígrafos: los españoles tienen derecho a saber.

La Mesa del Congreso la preside el candidato que obtiene más apoyos de entre los miembros del Congreso de los Diputados. El discurso de ganadores o perdedores ignora  la esencia misma del sistema parlamentario español, dictaminado en la Constitución Española.

En agosto de 1936, comunistas y socialistas arrojaron al vacío por el tajo de Ronda (Málaga) a 512 personas, una tras otra, incluidas mujeres y niños, por no ser de izquierdas. Una a una, sí. Eventos que no recoge la memoria democrática del PSOE.

John Durham's report on the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign’s work with Russia, which produced no startling revelations, is being viewed by some conservatives as lending credence to their conspiracy theories about the U.S. agency.

Russian terrorists. The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror. It’s only Ukraine's victory that will return security. And this victory will come. The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else.

All services are working. I have convened the National Security and Defense Council. Please spread official and verified information only.

The whole world knows about this Russian war crime, the crime of ecocide – the deliberate destruction of the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant by the Russian occupiers. In fact, Russian terrorists have detonated an environmental bomb of mass destruction.

For the sake of their own security, the world should now show that Russia will not get away with such terror. And I am grateful to all leaders and states, all nations and international organizations that have supported Ukraine and are ready to help our people and our de-occupation efforts. Life must prevail, Ukraine must win!

Thank you to everyone who supports Ukraine.

Few people understand that Twitter is billions in debt. 

If Elon didn’t purchase the company, there would have been a very highly likelihood of Twitter filing for bankruptcy.

We've proven time and time again that the 2020 election was stolen from President Trump.

Readers added context they thought people might want to know
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the Nov 2020 election (presidential or any other race). The assertion has been rejected by election officials and 50+ courts (state and federal). Joe Biden did not ""steal"" the election.

Bullets from handguns typically pierce straight through a target, medical experts say.

But higher caliber guns — like the AR-15s used in many mass shootings — can literally liquefy organs.

And the damage is much worse in children.
npr.org
This is how handguns and assault weapons affect the human body
The effect of assault weapons is much greater in children, as the surface area of their organs and arteries are smaller, said Dr. Joseph Sakran, a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

The area in yellow is affected.
Readers added context they thought people might want to know
In Egbert v Boule, SCOTUS found the 4th amendment claims did not meet the criteria for government civil liability (Bivens Test) and declined to extend new liability to 1st amendment claims. Existing 1A & 4A protections are not impacted. Border zone is defined by 8 CFR 287

Average rent is $2,000. Average income $50,000

1990? Average rent $500. Average income $30,000

It's simple. Rent has gone up 4x. Income hasn't even doubled.

Maybe millennials aren't broke due to the avocado toast.

With assault rifles, exit wounds can be a foot wide. The victim’s skull explodes on impact. Organs rupture, bones shatter, the shards serve as shrapnel and tear tissue to pieces.

There is a reason we never see the images after a mass murder—many of the bodies no longer exist.

Although this article claims to be comprehensive, it ignores Texas' S.B. 8. 

Under S.B. 8, doctors who terminate a pregnancy because of a medical emergency may face lawsuits. They must then prove—in court, by a preponderance of evidence—that the abortion was medically necessary.

Abortion advocates insist that pro-life laws are a threat to women with miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. So I compiled the text of each law’s medical-emergency exception and definition of abortion. Turns out abortion advocates are demonstrably wrong. https://nationalreview.com/2022/07/how-every-state-pro-life-law-handles-ectopic-pregnancy-and-miscarriage/…

Swartz was never convicted or sentenced to prison. After declining a plea bargain in which he'd serve six months in jail, he committed suicide before trial.

Today, an Israeli soldier executed a young Palestinian in broad daylight. Palestinians are sad and angry. These crimes happen daily, especially across cities and villages in the West Bank. As I warned, we're about to witness a new reality in the West Bank and beyond.

The shooting was captured on video. “It showed an Israeli soldier holding the Palestinian man in a headlock… The man then appears to strike the soldier and attempt to take hold of his rifle.” The soldier shot him several times with his handgun. Soldiers blocked medics.

Cicero defines Trump

Cicero did not say these words; he died a year before the attribution.

Novelist Taylor Caldwell attributed them to Cicero in her 1965 book of fiction, ‘A Pillar of Iron’ (p 661). This version of the falsely attributed quote surfaced in 2017 on Facebook.

US assistance to Ukraine is 5.6% of the defense budget. There is no direct correlation between taxes deducted from paychecks and the defense budget. Payroll taxes fund Social Security, Medicare and unemployment. State income tax rates vary: some states have none.

Bill Maher debunks the crass logic of The Science™ behind the Covid restrictions.

“I'm just asking, how much wrong do you get to be while still holding the default setting for people who represent the science?”

You deserve to know the origins of COVID.
You deserve to know why the DOJ went after parents.
You deserve to know why American lives were lost in Afghanistan.

Your Republican majority is in pursuit of the truth and will hold this administration accountable.

With every war going all the way back to Vietnam, the press has been heavily integrated with the troops and there's thousands of hours of live video footage. 

In Ukraine, nothing. 

We get no footage, no detailed updates, no graphs explaining how the war is going, who has control of what land, etc.

All we get is Biden fake air raid sirens and one famous actor or politician a day happily prancing around Kiev with Zelenskyy with no helmets or body protection offering him 100s of billion of dollars.   

Or, Zelenskyy jet setting around the world to walk red carpets, get praised by the global elite, and pose for national magazine covers. 

If you question this - you're called a Putin puppet.

We taxpaying citizens are sick and damn tired of these blatant lies from these evil, globalist worms.

Call us whatever names you want - we know bullshit when we see it.

A friend of mine, who works in a public university,  sent this to me earlier this week 

It's p. 1 of the DEI training his department is forced to take, starting w/ an exercise that asks which intersectional identities you'd save and which you'd leave to die.

This is demonic.

A brain imaging study on over 60,000 people found that the 2 things that aged your brain the most were schizophrenia and weed. 

Far worse than alcohol or cigarettes. 

Stop pretending weed is healthy.

The screen cap refers to controversial research from 2018, which “appears to prioritize marketing over science.” Also, “no major research institution takes [Daniel Amen’s] SPECT work seriously.” Finally, “the long-term benefits and risks of cannabis use remain unclear.”

Biden is single-handedly destroying the justice system in America. After tonight, Biden will go down as the most corrupt and despotic President in our nation's history.
